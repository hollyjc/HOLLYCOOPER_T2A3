This terminal application uses Web Scraping with Etsy to \ntrack the price desired item, and alert the user via email when the item is at\nor below their desired price.\nThe item I have decided to track is a pair of Dr Phil earrings sold on Etsy.\nWhen the earrings fall below a price of $11.50 AUD, the application will send\nme an email to my outlook account, sent from my gmail. The application will \ncheck the price once each day. This can be changed to be more frequent or less \nfrequent, by modifying the timer. If the item is below $11.50 AUD, an email \nwill be sent and the terminal will display a message to let the user know that\nthe email has been sent successfully. If the item is *not* under the $11.50, a \nmessage will be printed to the terminal to let the user know that no email has been \nsent, as the price has not fallen.\n\nLook how easy this terminal application is to use:\n\nRun python3 main.py in the terminal\nThe terminal will connect to Etsy using the API\nIf the item is below $11.50 AUD an email will be sent, and the user will be\nnotified that the user has been sent an email, that includes the link to the \namazon product. \n\n\n## Features\n------------------------------------------------------------\n- Solves the problem of not knowing when to buy an item - avoid overpaying.\n- A user can purchase the item that they desire within their budget/price that \n- they are willing to pay.\n- A much more convenient way than checking the item you want to buy each day - let this terminal application do the hard work for you, and simply email you when the item is at or below your desired price.\n\n## Installation\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInstall HOLLYCOOPER_T2A3 by opening this file and running the following in\nthe terminal:\npython3 main.py \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n## Flow Chart\n![Flow Chart](HOLLYCOOPER_T2A3.png)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Trello Board Screen Shots\n\n![Trello Board Screen Shots #1](HOLLYCOOPER_T2A3-1.png)\n![Trello Board Screen Shot #2](HOLLYCOOPER_T2A3-2.png)\n![Trello Board Screen Shots #3](HOLLYCOOPER_T2A3-3.png)\n![Trello Board Screen Shots #4](HOLLYCOOPER_T2A3-4.png)\n![Trello Board Screen Shots #5](HOLLYCOOPER_T2A3-5.png)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## App Screnshots \n![Email sent terminal message](HOLLYCOOPER_T2A3-nosent.png)\n![Email has not been sent terminal message](HOLLYCOOPER_T2A3-sent.png)\n![Screenshot of email](HOLLYCOOPER_T2A3-Terminal.png)","undoManager":{"mark":-1,"position":-1,"stack":[]},"ace":{"folds":[],"scrolltop":767.5,"scrollleft":16,"selection":{"start":{"row":68,"column":52},"end":{"row":68,"column":52},"isBackwards":false},"options":{"guessTabSize":true,"useWrapMode":false,"wrapToView":true},"firstLineState":{"row":46,"state":"start","mode":"ace/mode/markdown"}},"timestamp":1601605824302}
